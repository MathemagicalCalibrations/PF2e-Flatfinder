# PF2e Flatfinder
A compendium of replacements for Feats, Actions and Activities to streamline running Flatfinder on Foundry. To be used with the Pathfinder 2e system and the Proficiency without Level variant enabled.
NOTE: this is module in very early development.

## How to use
Install the module and activate it in your Pathfinder 2e World. Remember to enable the Proficiency without Level variant in the Game Settings and to set the Untrained Proficiency Penalty to -2.
The module adds the Flatfinder compendium, which contains the modified versions of the game elements changed by Flatfinder. Simply use those marked (FF) instead of the vanilla Pathfinder items when browsing the Compendiums.

## What is included (and what isn't)
- Most Actions, Activities and Feats modified by Flatfinder have a modified version included in the module. Earn Income and Craft are still missing.
- The changes for Incapacitation, Ritual DCs, and Creature Templates are not implemented. Neither is Unified Equipment Quality.
- The description of the Treat Wounds activity has a table which can "roll" the heal results for you, but you must manually roll the Medicine check. **For it to work, it must be added to the character sheet of whoever is attempting the check**
  - The description of the Risky Surgery feat has an alternative table to roll from.
  - Medic Dedication correctly modifies the heal amounts of both the Treat Wounds table and the Risky Surgery table.
